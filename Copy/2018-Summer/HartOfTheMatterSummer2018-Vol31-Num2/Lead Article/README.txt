Hi Mike,

I tried my hand at InDesign for this.  I'll include both the InDesign file, and the resultant PDF.  
I really just wanted to convey how I wanted the big text to catch the eye of a casual reader...  
I just wanted folks disinclined to read the thing to see those big titles like "Foodie", etc.

Maybe you can use this directly, or at least you'll get the idea of what I was after.

Lastly, please see README in "Other Silents Stuff" directory.  You might be ableto use one of the images here, if it helps.

Bill
