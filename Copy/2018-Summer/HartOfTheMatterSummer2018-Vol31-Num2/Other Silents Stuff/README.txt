Hi Mike,

Please scatter these around, away from the lead article I suppose?  Or maybe the smaller one can go with the lead article?..  Whatever works!  I just don't want all the Silents stuff one right after the other.

If you’re short on space, you could leave out the smaller one, but I really need the bigger one featured big in the issue.  One of our members actually drew/painted it!  :)  Please give the big one (meaning “Silents Promo test 5 copy”) it’s own, full page.  

Oh, and it comes with a blank page 2… can you trim that off please?  I don’t have the program on this computer to edit a PDF.

Thanks!,

Bill
