Mike,

Please make it look something like last time, EXCEPT, please rotate the mailing side of the back page 180 degrees, so that the fold is on the bottom when the stamp is on the top.  This will save us $0.20 per issue non-machinable fee.

ALSO, I think I will be sending this to you without all the membership names, because the person that gives me those is out of town.  Hopefully we can get everything as close as possible, and then drop those in and go to press as soon as she gets back.

Thanks,

Bill.

Update 6/14:  Sent Special Membership section to you in e-mail.

Bill
