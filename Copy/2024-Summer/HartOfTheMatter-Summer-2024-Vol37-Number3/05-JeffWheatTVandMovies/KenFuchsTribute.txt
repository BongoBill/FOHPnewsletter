Editor's Note:  continuing a tribute to our friend and Board Member, Jeff Wheat, here is a tribute from his former TV Director and friend, along with some great photos from an amazing Movie (including co-starring with Sean Connery!) and TV careers.

Jeff Wheat, my friend, forever and always, lost his battle with cancer on Saturday [12/16/20203] and has passed on.
I will miss Jeff dearly for his dedication to the show, talent as a cameraman and mostly for his friendship.
Personally I’ve had him on every day of every show I’ve ever done and we’ve been through it all together.
I think in the 22 years together on Feud, Tank, Bachelor, and other shows, I’ve spent over 2,000 days working together with Jeff.  He was a rock.  Always on time, always in focus, always making all of us look good.  I knew I could always take his shot….he was always there, telling the story.
He made me a better Director with his questions (sometimes a lot of questions) and his concern for the show.  Jeff ALWAYS put the show first.
I know we will all miss him dearly and our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Pam.
R.I.P. camera 3!
May your memory be for a blessing!
