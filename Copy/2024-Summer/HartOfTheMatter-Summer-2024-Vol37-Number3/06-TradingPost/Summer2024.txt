The recent Cowboy Festival brought many old and new shoppers into the FOHP Gift Store and Bookstore.  We had our best weekend of sales since everything was shut down with Covid.  It was great fun to see and visit with old friends and make new acquaintances and have the opportunity to tell them about Hart Park and, of course, sell them some of our outstanding inventory.  Both stores were open on Saturday and Sunday and the dance area next to the Ranch House and the Animal Barnyard brought many Festival goers to our end of the Park.  We have missed the large events in the Park and look forward to many more in the future. 
 
The Critters event put on by the Barnyard staff was also a big hit with local visitors, and once again our stores were both open and had excellent customer support.  We thank our store volunteers -- Gail, Evan, Michele and family members and the Park staff for helping out at both events!
