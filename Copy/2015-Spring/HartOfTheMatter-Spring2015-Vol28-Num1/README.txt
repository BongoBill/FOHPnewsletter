Hi Mike,

As always, please try to keep it to 10 pages or less...  keeping the photos as big as you can get away with and still stay 10 or under.

Except for the lead article which should start on page 1 (hopefully with its long sidebar article starting there), and the last page, put them in any order that works for you.

THANKS SO MUCH!!!

Bill
