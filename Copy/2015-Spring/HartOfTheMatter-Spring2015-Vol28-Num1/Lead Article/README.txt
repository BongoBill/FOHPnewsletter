Hi Mike,

The "Main Article.docx" should be the lead, 1st page articles.

If possible, start the sidebar on the first page too, and then go on to subsequent pages, If there's no room for the sidebar, it can go whereever... preferrably near the main article.

The pictures of Cow Bop and Buffalo Bill should go with the main article near their mention in the main article, using the captions below.  

The Map image can go with either article, wherever it fits well.

Caption for Buffalo Bill:  Peter Sherayko as Buffalo Bill will be perforing Saturday Apr. 18th in Hart Mansion.

Caption for Cow Bop:  Western Swing Hall of Famers, Cow Bop, performs in Hart's Living Room on Friday, Apr. 17th.

Caption for the Map:  This year, Cowboy Festival comes to Bill Hart's ranch!

Thanks!,

Bill
