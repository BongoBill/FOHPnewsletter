Hi Mike,

It'd be great if this could be kept on 1 page.  Maybe that's tough to do... if you're only over by a picture or two, maybe ditch a picture or two.  Or, go to 2 pages, just so the total number of pages is 10 or less... 

The hartsbirthdayTitle.tiff should be, well, the title with the rest of the pictures subordinate to (undeneath, surrounding) it.

Thanks!

Bill
