Hi Mike,

Another case of too much stuff... and for one reason or another, it really all should be in this issue.

So, to make that more likely, please:

* put the "Article A-E"s in any order that makes the best use of space.
* please include whatever you can from the "Optional" directory.
* Please wrap the text as close as you can to the pictures, so the photos can stay big enough to be legible.
* If possible, keep it to 10 pages, but 12 is OK.

Please send me drafts (starting in about a week, like usual?) whenever makes sense, but don't forward to George until I give the final OK, OK?   Don't feel like you have to send me one before you're done with the initial edit... I mean, don't rush it, as we're not as late as usual.  :) 

Thanks!

Bill
