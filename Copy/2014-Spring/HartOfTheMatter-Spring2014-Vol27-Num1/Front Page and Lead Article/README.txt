Hi Mike,

As you can tell from the names, there's a sidebar article to go with the main one.

Again, please wrap around the photo to keep it big enough to be legible.

If I get a solid date for "Silents Under the Stars", I will let you know, possibly in time to remove the "tentatively", but I expectd not to.

Note, this issue is Vol. 27, Num 1.

Thanks,

Bill
