Hi Mike,

Sorry the LizAndBill.tif graphic is so small.. that was all anyone could find.  Can you make it work?  If not, let me know and I'll call Bill and ask him for another.

Please make both images look the same size on the page.

ElinorAndElliott caption:  "Elinor and Elliott McGrew"
LizAndBill caption:  "Elizabeth and Bill Crowl"

Also, like everything I give you, it's a mishmash of fonts, and please do like always and make them "right".  I do think the poem in the Elliott article she be in italics or something different to set it off.  Also, if you can, perhaps the "Editor's Note" in the Elliott article could be in a type-writer style font (kinda like it currently is), since it's, well, an editor's note.

OH, and perhaps most important... if you're short on room (very likely I'm afraid), drop the poem from the Elliott article.

Thanks,

Bill
