Hi Mike,

I couldn't get an article out of anyone for Cowboy Festival, so I'm just gonna copy basically what I did for this:  http://friendsofhartpark.com/Event_Pages/cowboyfest.html.  So, if you could organize roughly like that, with one small main article, and two sub-articles, I think it'll be good enough.  
Thanks!

Bill
