Hi Mike!

I think I'd like to lead with the "Animal Report"... and then put "Happenin's 'Round the House" next?  I want those two articles to bookend each other in some fashion, since they're both about the fire... first and last?  First 2?  If it fits better,feel free to put Happenin's first and Animal Report next.

IF you think it would look good, perhaps under the main "Hart of the Matter" title, say:

"Special FIRE Edition!"

because of those two articles.  If you do that, then maybe that subtitle should be removed from each of the two articles.  I'll leave it to your artistic discretion.

As for the rest of the articles (except for "Back Page" of course), please use whatever order you like.

As always, make the photos as big as you can, still keeping the thing 10 pages or less.  I think the Silents Under the Stars photos probably will need 2 facing pages?

If the darn thing is just too big this time, maybe we can ditch some pictures... or splurge on a 12 page issue this time.  Lemme know if it's a little over, or WAY over, and we can decide.

Thanks amigo!

Bill
