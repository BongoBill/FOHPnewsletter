Hey Mike,

The gift store people sent me a snapshot of their store... like they wanted me to use it... I dunno... if there's no room, feel free to skip the picture.

But, I was wondering if you can think of a way to turn that image into the title of the piece, rather than your usual "Trading Post" graphic... like maybe the "Trading Post" in the photo is enough?  Or, maybe your own "Trading Post" words, with the picture included along-side, like the bi-line images for the animal report and the Happenin's article. That might be nice to be similar to the other recurring articles. 

Just some ideas.  Feel free to be creative...

Thanks!

Bill
