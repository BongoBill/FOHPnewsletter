Hi Mike,

I can never really tell if I have more than 10 pages... So as always, let me know if I gave you too much, and I can probably move some things to Summer 2019.

The big event that means I'm late getting this to you :) is Cowboy Festival on 4/13, and so if you can turn this around in your usual week or two, that'd be great!

Thanks as always Mike!

Bill
