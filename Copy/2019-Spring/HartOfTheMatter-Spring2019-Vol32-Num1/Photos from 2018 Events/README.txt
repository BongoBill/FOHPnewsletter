Hi Mike,

Each group can be spread around wherever convenient, and feel free to leave out photos if they're getting shrunk down too much to be viewable...

Maybe make the 3 sections -- if you do spread them around have a similar font or maybe even heading like "Fall-Winter 2018 Look-back:  " preceding each one?  Just a thought.  Feel free to disregard....  I'm kibitzing too much here.

Thanks,

Bill
