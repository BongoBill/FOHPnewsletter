Hi Mike,

I would consider these optional, especially those in the subdirectory.  I feel like I gave you too much this year, and I want to keep this under 10 pages if at all possible.

If, on the other hand, 12 pages will "just fit" better, I can spring for extra postage this one time, but I'd rather not.

And, to repeat what I said in the top README, if you need me to, I can even remove an entire article and save it for next time.

Then, I always think we're out of room, and you somehow pull it off!

Thanks,

Bill
