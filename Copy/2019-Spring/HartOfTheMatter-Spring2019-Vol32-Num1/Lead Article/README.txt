Hi Mike,

Please use the material in the CowboyFest.docx file, but layout like this website:  https://friendsofhartpark.com/Event_Pages/cowboyfest.html.

You can leave out the 2-sentence blurb on the bottom if short of room.

Also, feel free to truncate the Upcoming Events if too much.  Namely:
* replace day and dates with just dates
* shorten some of the names like Pow Wow Native American Craft Fair can just be Pow Wow
* leave off stuff towards the end of the year.  It would be good to include up to Silents

Specifically, at a minimum, include these events, truncated as follows:
1. Cowboy Festival
2. Music in the Park
3. Artisan Row Home Arts & Craft Show
4. SCV Quilt Show
5. Saxtravaganza Concert
6. Movies in the Park
7. Silents Under the Stars
8. Pow Wow
9. Bow Wows

... would be good enough, with their associated dates.

Thanks!

Bill
