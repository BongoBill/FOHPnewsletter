Hi Mike,

As you can see, the "lead article" is actually a series of Bios.  I managed to find photos of everyone... Could you please make them all about the same size in each sub-article (small is fine)?  I don't want to look like I'm playing favorites.  :)  The picture that goes with the intro can be bigger... big enough to tell what it is anyway.

Back to not playing favorites with the authors, if you could put them in order by last name, great!  (If it doesn't work, that's fine too...  doesn't really matter.)

Here they are (in alphabetical order) starting of course with my "Letter from the Editor":

my intro
Bill Blowers
John Boston
Bill Lyons
Maggi Perkins
E.J. & Kimi Stephens

Finally, if I could art-direct a little, maybe each author's Bio could be titled with some similar style that easily identifies it as another article in this series... maybe something that separates them well from each other.  I'll give an example of the kind of thing I'm thinking about in the Bill Blower's article.

As always, I really leave the art direction to you, so whatever you do will be great! I'm sure you can come up with something better, that looks less like a MS Word formatting gimmick.  :)

Thanks!

Bill
