Hi Mike,

If this is on the verge of fitting on a single page (unlikely, I realize), let me know, and I can trim it down.  If we're well into the 2nd page, then oh well....  Definitely not worth more than 2 pages, so again let me know, and I'll cut it back.

Remember to skooch the text near the oval image to get more in.

Thanks,

Bill
