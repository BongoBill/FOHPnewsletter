Hi Mike,

Due to various authors insisting they be included, one writer writing 1000 words when I asked for 500, and my inability to tell them no, this will be another huge issue.  Oh well... 

However, if it goes over 12 pages, let me know... postal regulations won't let us mail more than that without putting it in an envelope.

The articles numbered 1, 2 and 3, I'd kinda like in that order starting with the lead (though if it doesn't work, I don't care that much).  The Articles A thru D can be in any order that makes the best use of space and looks best to you.

Also, to make this over-long issue a little easier to read, please:

1)  Use multi-column most of the time... an occasional single-column is OK, but multi- will make such a text-heavy edition like this a little easier on the eyes.

2)  Please wrap the text around the pictures wherever possible, so we can squeeze more in.  It also looks more fancy than a big horizontal blank strip with a picture in it.

3)  Please use your judgment on how big to make the pictures.  Smaller is OK, if you think the photo still conveys its basic message.

Hopefully the next issue will be under 10 pages!

If you could turn this around in your usual 1-week, with a few proofs along the way, that would be wonderful.

Thanks!,

Bill.
