Hi Mike,

Please make me a sidebar, like you did before.

Also, sorry about the footnotes in the main text.  Guess the author wanted to be scholarly.  Just be careful pasting it all in, so the footnote stay looking like footnotes.  Feel free to make them as small as possible, but still (barely) legible.

Bill
