Hi Mike,

If there's room (unlikely, I know), please include the following, in the following order of importance (but I recognize, there may be room for a less-important... whatever you can fit in, or nothing):

1.  Rhylite Article.
2.  July 4th Article... if possible, include on the same page(s) as the 2nd (Pow Wow) article.
3.  The Cowboys and Carols graphic

Thanks,

Bill
