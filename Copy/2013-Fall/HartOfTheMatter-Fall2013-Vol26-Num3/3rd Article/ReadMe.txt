Hi Mike,

If you can't fit this and the couple of photos on 2 pages, let me know, and I'll cut some of the text out.

(If a miracle happens, and you actually have room for more, see additional photos in folder.  I wonder if the silly one with the moon might make a good upper-right-hand-corner images like you did last time?)

Feel free to use image names as captions, or skip the captions as you see fit.

Thanks,

Bill
