Mike,

This story is long-ish, but I like it all and couldn't bring myself to edit any of it down.  If you're running out of room, maybe you can trim some of the photo captions?  Much of it is already in the story, so the captions don't need to be that long.  Please use your judgment.

Thanks,

Bill.
