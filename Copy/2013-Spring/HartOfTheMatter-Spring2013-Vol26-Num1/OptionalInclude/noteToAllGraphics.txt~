Hi Mike,

Here's the stuff I'm hoping we'll have room for.  The one I'd like to see most (if there's only room for one) is SilentsDateChosen.png.  Second is UpcomingEvents.

Like I said in the main readme, please use as many of these as you can to fill up 10 pages.  If we're over 10 pages without any of these, then I'll spend for the extra postage, and lets go up to 14.

Thanks,

Bill.
