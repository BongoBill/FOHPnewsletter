Amigo!

Been gone all day and just sitting down in the office for an hour -- then, off to the gym. Give me a call any time asap to discuss (I don't have your phone #s for some reason).

In the short term, I think you have to respect YOUR editor hat. I have made my case as the writer.

You are making yours as the editor.

Might I suggest: Take out the "crazy" from the Obama (they so are, by the way) fan reference.

Next, instead of anyone living, how about: "the ghost of Tubercio Vasquez, who had a history of strange relationships. If it wasn’t, this newsletter comes out in another six months or something and we’ll bury a contrite “clarification” somewhere in really teeny type, because we and Bill Hart aren't afraid of any darn rum-soaked ghosts."

As a test, if you have an involuntary breath of release, it's probably the right call for you.

Thanks for stepping up, but the way, and doing this.

Holler if you need anything...
