Hey Bill-
 
Boy, did I wait until the last minute or what??  Sorry to be right on the deadline here … I have been waiting to hear if I have clearance to use the photos, and I kinda sorta do, so I’m going to send this on over to you.  If you can use this article in the upcoming issue, can you include a line that says, “All photos courtesy of the Seaver Center for Western History Research, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History”?
 
And I do like the idea of a regular column called “Happenin’s Round the House” but hey!  You’re the editor – title this bad boy any way you want J
 
Otherwise, edit away, my fellow editor!  I included some captions for the photos, but you can use them, delete them, modify them, whatever you want / need to do J
 
Thanks!
Rachel
