P.S.  Oh, Mr. Editor, I did receive the full clearance to use the Mary Ellen images in the article I submitted to you.  Please, please include somewhere the line that all the images are courtesy of the Seaver Center for Western History Research, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History (gosh, what a mouthful), and Iâ€™m also supposed to let you know that the images can only be used for the singular issue of the Hart of the Matter (so no publishing on the web, sadly), and if we want to use them for any other means, I will have to go back and get further permissions.  Sound good?  Or sound like a lot of legaleze? J
