The FOHP Gift Store is gearing up for the annual Cowboy Festival that will take place April 18th-21st in the SCV.  This is the second largest cowboy festival in the U.S. and it brings in hundreds of visitors from out-of-town into our valley and gives us the chance to introduce many of them to the charm of Wm. S. Hart Park and Museum.  This year the Friends will be co-sponsoring a new event with the City of Santa Clarita featuring a guided tour of the Cowboy Walk of Stars in Old Downtown Newhall followed by a lunch at Hart Hall.  In addition, participants will be presented with a talk on Bill Hart and then will be taken on a walk around the Park to view Fritz' Grave, the Ranch House, and then on up the trail past the Dogs' Graveyard and Bunkhouse to the Mansion/Museum where they will receive a guided tour by museum staff and docents.  To finish off the event the group (limited to 50) will come back down the hill and will be treated to refreshments and a showing of "Tumbleweeds" back in Hart Hall.  About half of the tickets have been sold as of the end of February; so we expect a "sell-out" for this walk-talk-tour-lunch and movie event.
 
The FOHP will also present a Friday night concert in the Hart Mansion/Museum featuring the headliner Don Edwards performing in Bill's living room for about 70 fortunate ticket holders.  On Saturday evening a rare appearance by Riders in the Sky will take place in the same location -- both events have limited seating and will sell out quickly!  Tickets available on the Cowboy Festival website -- cowboyfestival.org
 
We hope to see you at our events and be sure to drop by the Gift Store to say "Howdy!" and to take a look at our great selection of Bill Hart and Western merchandise.
