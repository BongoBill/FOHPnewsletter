    Incidentally, back then we literally made a "cut & paste" master.  I wrote or re-typed and printed all of the articles, cut them up with scissors, arranged and pasted them onto a poster board with soft wax as  the adhesive. I  then rolled them flat with a wire handled wooden roller.  Then I drove it to John Mann, our Printer up Sierra Hwy.  He would make the litho plate and print.  I'd go back for them a few days later and prepare for mailing.  Gad! sounds like old grandad talking about walking 20 miles to school in the year of the 'Big blizzard'.  But it is a valuable contribution -- Thanks for your work.
