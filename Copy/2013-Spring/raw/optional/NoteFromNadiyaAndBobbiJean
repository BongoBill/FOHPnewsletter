Hey Bill, just a very small reminder that this is also the 20th anniversary year of the powwow.
I'll be with BobbiJean at the buckaroo bookstore for cowboy poetry with my gourd people as will other artists and writers.
Cheers!  Nadiya

We will have a number of interesting authors with us at the Buckaroo Book Shop and a fun evening event (not connected to the Festival) Friday night 4/19 - its an evening of live music and poetry honoring Les Buffham, named the Western Music Association's Poet of the Year in 2012 - and was a longtime Saugus resident. SCVTV may film it.
