Bill,

At the Cowboy Poetry Festival, the City will be dedicating a plaque just outside Hart Park to my Dad, Stuart Hamblen.

Would you like my son (Bill Lindsay) to send you ASAP an article about my Dad.  If so, would you like a picture or pictures?

Bill is President of Hamblen Music Co., and I think he could send an article he wrote for another Hall of Fame Award without much problem.

Lisa
