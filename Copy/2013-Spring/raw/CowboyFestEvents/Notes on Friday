Once you read the two accounts of the Fri. tour, you will wonder what is really going on.  Roger and I are arranging it, and here is what is going to go on:
 
1.  11:00 check in Hart Hall
2.  EJ & Kim (along with Andree and Carl) tour Main St. and the Cowboy Walk of
     Stars discuss stars and Newhall
3.  Noon back into Hart Hall for catered lunch and Roger to talk about Bill Hart
4.  Divide group into two with Roger and Jack Stewart plus volunteers
     A Group take van to Mansion, Margi & Rachel + volunteers do tour and a guide
         walks them to Ranch House, barns, and Fritz's grave and to HH
     B Group exists HH to Fritz Grave, barns, and Ranch House and then a van up to 
         the Mansion and then a guide walks them down the hill to HH 
5.  Everyone now in HH and Roger talk about Tumbleweeds and answer questions and
      watch Tumbleweeds with snacks.   (DONE...all for $25..sounds like fun, and IF by
       some strange case you are available please say so and come help us).
 
Hope that clears it up for you
 
Roger and Becki
