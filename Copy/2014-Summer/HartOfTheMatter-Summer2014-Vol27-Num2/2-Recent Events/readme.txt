Hi Mike,

These don't have to go on the same page, but might look nice if they did.. up to you.

Please divide them with headers using the wordings of the folder.  That is,

Cowboy Festival at the Hart
Pacific Islander Festival in Hart Park

Please make the pictures as big as possible while fitting in the available space.

Thanks,

Bill
