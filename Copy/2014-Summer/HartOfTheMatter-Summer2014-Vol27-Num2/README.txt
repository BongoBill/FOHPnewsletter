Hi Mike!

Here we go again!

As always, try to keep at 10 pages, but 12 can work if needed.

This time, let's make the fonts smaller if needed, and the pictures bigger.  I think folks enjoy looking at the pictures more than reading the text.  :)

Dip into the Optional directory if you could use a space-filler, but, again, I'd rather have the photos be larger than have more "stuff".

The numbers preceding each directory (1-, 2-, etc) are only a suggestion for the order.  If a different order makes better use of the space, feel free!

If you could get this in under 2 weeks, like you always have, I'd really appreciate it!  Got a late start this time.  

Thanks!

Bill
