Silents Under the Stars a Great Success!

Thanks to all who attended and volunteered for the return of Silents Under the Stars!  It was a great hit, as evidenced by the photos (click below), along with a wonderful article written in the SCV Signal by the SCV Signal's reporter Michael Picarella with photographs by photographer Habeba Mostafa.
