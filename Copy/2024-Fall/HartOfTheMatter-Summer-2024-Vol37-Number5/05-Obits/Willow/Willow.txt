Our beautiful 16-yr old, female mule deer - Willow  - passed away peacefully this morning.  She had suffered a stroke and was in an unrecoverable condition.  I, along with my coworkers, Kim & Chris (not pictured), took turns holding and comforting her, until our vet arrived.  Thank you so much to our vet, Dr. Cauble, for rushing to help her transition as peacefully as possible.  Reminds me of my Dad passing from the same thing, a year ago.  It is so hard to lose our loved ones.. but, I can tell you one thing:  This is the look of LOVE.  RIP, sweet Willow  - until we meet again.
