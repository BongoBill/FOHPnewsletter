Hi Mike,

I may have too many photos here...  Please feel free to delete some as you see fit.  If it all only takes up a page, that's fine, or whatever looks good to you.

You can also split then into 3 different sections of the newsletter, if that works out better.  E.g.:
* Autumnal Events in Review:  Bow Wows & Meows pet fair
* Autumnal Events in Review:  Pow Wow Native American Craft Fair
* Autumnal Events in Review:  Friends of Hart Park volunteer dinner

Thanks,

Bill
