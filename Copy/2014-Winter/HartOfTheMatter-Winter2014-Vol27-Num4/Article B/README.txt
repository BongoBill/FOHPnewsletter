Hi Mike,

Please caption the WillRogers.tiff picture with "Will Rogers".

Please put the two book covers on either side of John's bio at the bottom... they can be really small... so they just provide sort of brackets for the Bio... just so they're large enough that "John Boston" and the book titles are legible is fine.

(Basically, I don't want to look like I'm giving someone advertising in our non-for-profit newsletter, but I think it's perfectly reasonable to show images of his books as part of mentioning his books in his bio.  :) )

Thanks,

Bill
