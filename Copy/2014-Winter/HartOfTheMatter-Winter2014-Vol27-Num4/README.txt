Hiya Mike,

Hopefully a less stressful one this time!  I do have one favor... I'd like to send out the newsletters before I go out of town on 11/6 (just to be sure they get to people in time for the 11/29 event), so don't go crazy-rush on it, but anything you can do to move it along would be appreciated!

Main thing:  you'll see the Back Page is empty!  That's because our volunteer that does the membership has left the board, and, despite promises, isn't sending me the data.  Sooo... could you leave that for last, as well as the image in the top level of the zip file called "AddAnywhereTherersAgoodSpot.tiff", and use that for the back page if I don't get anything to you soon?

If I do get something from her in the next day or two, I'll send it, andthen go ahead and use "AddAnywhereTherersAgoodSpot.tiff", well, anywhere you have a good spot.  :)

Sorry about that confusion, and let me clarify my time constraint by saying Don't kill yourself on this one!  If it's too late to get out before I go out of town, who cares!  We need to have an easier newsletter after the last couple!  :)

Thanks so much for all your hard work!

Bill
