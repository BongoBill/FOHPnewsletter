Hi Mike!

Hopefully you can fit this all on the first page, including the image if possible.

I got wordy on the "Upcoming Events" to try to hide the fact that I have no dates for 2015...  but if you need room, please feel free to cut down the words in the two events to something more succint.  (e.g., don't really need the "Hart Hall" or the phone number.)

Thanks!

Bill
