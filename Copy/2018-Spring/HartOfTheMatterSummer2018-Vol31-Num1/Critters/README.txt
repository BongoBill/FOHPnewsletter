Hi Mike,

Please title this whole mess "Critter Corner", with the picture of Rachael and the snake and its caption as kind of a biline pic.

You can delete one of the two closeups of the horse if it works out better to do so.

If you could make the poem be in a script font, or something to set is off as a "poem", you know...

Thanks!

Bill
