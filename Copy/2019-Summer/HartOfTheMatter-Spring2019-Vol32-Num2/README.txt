Hi Mike,

Here we go... if you get the sense that this isn't going to happen, either because of your situation or George's, please let me know.

If it is, Let's try to keep it 10 pages, thought one last hurrah with extra postage I suppose wouldn't be out of the question, but we can never go over 12.

Hope this finds you well!

Bill
