Hi Mike,

I realize we're short on room, and I'd like to keep this to 
the 10 pages to keep postage down...  So, if there's not room,
this can keep till next issue.

If there is, I'm thinking the BOLD part of the caption can stand 
out as the title and the caption all together, to save space.

Bill
