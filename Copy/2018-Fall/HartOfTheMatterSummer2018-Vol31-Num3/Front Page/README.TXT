Hi Mike,

Let's make the Silents article in the subdirectory the 
lead article.  

On the Upcoming Events, you can delete the first one if we're
into mid-september when you get done, 'cause it might be past.

Pow Wow, is the biggie... we have to make that.  You can shorten
it to "Native American Pow Wow" if that helps.

Lastly, the photos that go with the article, feel free to not use some 
if you think its better to have fewer, larger photos.  I would like to 
keep the one with the two guys at the picnic table, 'cause I'm one of
them.  :) Also, if it works to put elsewhere in the newsletter and label
them "More pics from Silents Under the Stars"... whatever works.

Bill
