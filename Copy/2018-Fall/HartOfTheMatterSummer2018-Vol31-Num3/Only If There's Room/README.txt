Hi Mike,

Only if there's room for these.... least important of the issue if not, so feel free to delete.  If you use them, a caption for both would say this:

    There was country music and Line Dancing at the ‚ÄùGoin' Country at the Hart" 
    events this summer, with a new one planned for October!

Thanks,

Bill
