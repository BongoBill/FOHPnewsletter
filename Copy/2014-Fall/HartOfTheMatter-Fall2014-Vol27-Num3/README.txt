Hi Mike!

Same old things... please try to get up to, but not over 10 pages, making the photos as large as possible.  Of course, the stock photos (the cowboy with the rose, the kids with the dogs for example) only need to be big enough to be discernable, but the Silents event photos and the Ito photos and the Prado photo... in other words *our* photos should be as big as you can get away with.

I am running late with this... hopefully you and George can make up for some of my lost time.  If this gets in folks hands too close Pow Wow, they'll have my (I have to say it) scalp.  :)

The numbers to the articles is only a suggestion... I just tried to lead with all the upcoming events, and put them in chronological order, and then make the remainder non-event things... but if it works out better to be in a different order, whatever makes sense to you works for me.

Thanks my friend,

Bill
