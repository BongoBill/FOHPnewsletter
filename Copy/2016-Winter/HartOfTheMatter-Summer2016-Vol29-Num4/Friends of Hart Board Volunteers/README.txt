Hi Mike,

If you can keep all these photos together, maybe label them 

"Friends of Hart Park Board Member volunteers"...

But if you end up scattering them around, then never mind.   Doesn't matter that much.

The picture of Hart Hall (in this same directory) would be good to put at least near the picture of several board members.

Even though some pictures are huge and some are small, please make each board member about the same size, so it doesn't look like we're highlighting anyone in particular.

Thanks!

Bill
