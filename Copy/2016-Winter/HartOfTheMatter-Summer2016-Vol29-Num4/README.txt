Hi Mike,

Thanks for the always-has-to-be rushed job.  :)  I appreciate your enthusiasm.

Feel free to arrange things however they work.

However, if it "just works out", I wanted to focus on people this issue, and if all the board members could be roughly colocated, and the barnyard members colocated and the museum members colocated, great.  If not, as long as the captions stay with the photos, that's fine.

It would really be cool if Carol Frost's picture was sort of between "Trading Post" and "Friends of Hart Park Board Members", since she is both, but, again, doesn't really matter.  Speed is more important than perfection.

Thanks again!

Bill
