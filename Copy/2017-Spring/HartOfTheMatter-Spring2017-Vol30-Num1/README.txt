Hey Mike!

Here ya go.  Lemme know if anything is missing/messed-up.

You'll notice, no Trading Post article and no Happenin's 'Round the House.  Don't know if those people are mad at me, or just forgot, but it seems like we have so much, it'll just be easier to skip it.

I will be seeing them Wednesday, and I half-expect they might say "oh, here", and give me something a week after the deadline I gave them... so I may be dumping another article on you, IF you have room and can still keep it under 10 pages.  If not, snooze-they-looze.  :)

Thanks amigo.

Bill
