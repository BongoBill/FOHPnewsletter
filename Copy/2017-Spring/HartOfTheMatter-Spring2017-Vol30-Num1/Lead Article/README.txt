Hi Mike,

The idea is the main article is on top of the other two, which are secondary to that.  Something like shown here:  http://friendsofhartpark.com/Event_Pages/cowboyfest.html

On the "Upcoming events", if you run out of room, you can remove one or two of the items at your discretion.  Please however, DON'T remove any of these though:
	Cowboy Fest
	Pacific Islander Fest
	Silents Under the Stars
	Pow Wow
	Bow Wows
	Cowboys and Carols
Ideally,  if you have to get rid of some, the ones (apart from the list above) that are later in the year might be the first to go?

Thanks!!

Bill
