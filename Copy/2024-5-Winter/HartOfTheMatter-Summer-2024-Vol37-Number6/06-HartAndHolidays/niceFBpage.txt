Hart and the Holidays

We just had to collect some Hart holiday photos for y'all...

The photo of the tree is one we had, that your intrepid editor attempted (with questionable success) to colorize.  The other two were found by a Friend of Hart Park, Geraldine Smith, on a Facebook page we've grown very fond of called "William S Hart - Appreciating the Silent Movie Star". We think they all capture Hart's love for the holidays!
