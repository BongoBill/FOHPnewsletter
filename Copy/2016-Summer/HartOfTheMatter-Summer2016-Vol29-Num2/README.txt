Hi Mike,

Wow, a ton of stuff happened, making for a large newsletter (additionally, see README in the Spin and Marty directory).  I'm hoping you can pull off one of your miracles, and make it all fit in 10 pages. 

If not, let me know how far over we are.  Maybe I'll spring for extra postage, or maybe split up the Spin and Marty article, or maybe just nuke something for next time.  One idea that comes to mind:  my lead article is just a rehash of what's said in the Silents/flyer graphic...  

So, perhaps feel free to nuke the lead article, and just put in the Silents flyer on that first page.  That might be a fine idea anyway.  Less is (especially with this issue) more!

Apologies in advance for not converting the JPGs to TIFFs... I didn't do much processing on them this time either... I just ran out of time... (Also, I am not sure my converting them to TIFFs does any good anyway, since I invariably get them as JPGs to begin with).

I also left them in color, in case you get 'round to making a color version of an e-newsletter, just so I can share it with the board.  Don't go to any trouble on that though... these folks are slow to move, and this is a huge newletter.  We can try that next time.

In the meantime, we'll still print this issue with George just like normal.

As always, I ran late on this, and want these in peoples hands in a month, prior to the Silents event, so if you can turn this around in your usual quick time, that'd be wonderful.

Thanks pardner,

Bill
