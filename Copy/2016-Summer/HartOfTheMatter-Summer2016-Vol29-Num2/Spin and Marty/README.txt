Hey Mike,

The guy that wrote this for me drove me absolutely crazy... he kept adding to it, and adding to it, until the "1000 words or less" I asked for turned into 2200+ words.

And when I suggested I might split it up into two issues, he became almost beligerant about it....

When I explained that our readers are more likely to read two short articles over two issues that one very long article, he would have none of it, but did suggest a smaller font.

Fine, so please include the whole thing if at all possible (if not, let me know and I will risk his wrath and split it up), but feel free to use as small a font as you need to keep it still legible, and the whole newsletter 10 pages or less (I'm not paying extra postage because of this guy's foul mood).

Sorry for keeping the images in-line.  I also included them as separate images, and that was the best quality he could manage, to my surprise.  I know he's picky about the placement of the images, so they go with the text, so I went ahead and left his originals in, so you could see about where they go relative to the paragraphs.  Again, if needed, feel free to make them smaller.

Despite my grumpiness, please do make the font and the images as large as you can get away with, but, again, not over 10 pages.

Thanks amigo, for dealing with all my instructions, and listening to all my griping.  :)

Bill
