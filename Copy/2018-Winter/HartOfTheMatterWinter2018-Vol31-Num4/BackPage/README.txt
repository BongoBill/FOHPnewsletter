Hi Mike,

We didn’t have any new members, so let’s just add last month’s “Special Membership”, which I’ll include here too.  If there’s not room for this and the horse, let’s just use the horse image.

Secondly, I know it would be a hassle to add "And Museum" to the Masthead of the newsletter, but maybe the 
back page could say "The Friends of Hart Park and Museum" for the return address? That oughta keep the museum people happy. :)

Thanks,
Bill
