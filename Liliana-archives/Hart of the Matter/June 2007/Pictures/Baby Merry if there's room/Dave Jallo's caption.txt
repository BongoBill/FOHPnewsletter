Just wanted to share a little bit of the good life here at Hart Park.  Take a look at the attached photographs of our Bison “Merry” and Donkey “Half Pint” taking a walk.  Our Barnyard Zoo is open 7 days a week 9:30 am until 3:00 PM. We also have plenty of healthy park trails to exercise on, whether you have 2 or 4 legs.  Please share this with your staff, friends and visitors.

 

Thanks.
