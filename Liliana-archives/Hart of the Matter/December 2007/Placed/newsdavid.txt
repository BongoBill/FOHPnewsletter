Many thanks to AV Equipment Rental,Inc.

Mr. Jeff White from AV Equipment Rental loaned a
lift truck to the park allowing us to clean leaves from
the museum roof and patch some holesin the walls.  We
used it for over a week.  Also fixed the flag pole and
some lights at the Senior Center.  This loan was valued
at $1400. and it allowed us to do several necessary
tasks at the museum and park. Many thanks to AV Equipment
Rental and Jeff.
